The author of the project has been involved in the embedded systems development for 10+ years during which 
he applied many debugging techniques including LEDs, UARTs, LAs, scopes, hardware and software debuggers.

One of the observations he has made is that no matter what the industry is, no matter what the development system is
teams and developers tend to create log files to analyze their systems and applications. In many cases these are many
megabytes files. As the experience shows there are engineers who go through them line by line to
analyze them and resolve the problem. But there are also guys, definitely more skilled, who create scripts to
process the logs for them. The author noticed that the approaches could be compromised by visualising the log. Not only does it provide the
big picture of the system but also one receives a kind of a freedom and a flexibility in the system exploration. By using any of the VCD viewers
one can measure the duration of time events or easily change the format of the displayed data.

Hopefully there will be engineers who will benefit from using the tool and make their make their debugging process more efficient.
